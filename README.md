# Sales Data Analysis Project
  This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a commercial store's sales dataset. The dataset includes transaction details such as customer 
  information, product categories, and sales amounts. Using Python and libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, this project visualizes key insights into sales trends, 
  customer behavior, and product performance.
# Key Features:
  1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and formatted sales data, handled missing values, and converted columns to appropriate formats.
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted a detailed analysis of sales patterns, customer demographics, and product performance.
  3. Data Visualizations: Created interactive and informative visualizations, including histograms, bar plots, and pie charts to present sales by age group, weekday, product 
                          category, and more.
  4. Sales Insights: Identified trends such as peak sales periods, most profitable products, and customer buying behavior.
# Technologies Used:
  Python: Main programming language.
  Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
  Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization.
